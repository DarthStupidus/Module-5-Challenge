Code contains all the coding and charts etc - and the original data files are also included.  My high level analysis is below:

The data shows that the drug that Pymaceuticals is interested in (Capomulin) is an effective drug in limiting tumour growth because along with Remicane had the smallest average tumour volume amongst surviving mice.  Capomulin and Remicane also had the greatest survival rate out of the treatments - so most survived, with relatively (compared to other treatments) tumours. 
 There was a decrease in the amount of timepoints observed for the other 8 remedies - which may be caused by the subjects dying.  

One outlier was identified with Infubinal - this result showed a reduction in tumour growth whereas all the other ones showed an increase in growth.  Whilst this may be worth exploring - as it is the desired result - to see whether a more preferable result can be established, it is only with this one mouse that this applies to - which suggests it is an outlier.

There is a strong positive correlation between mouse mass and tumour volume i.e. the bigger the mouse, the bigger the tumour.  Whilst this could be a factor in the effectiveness of any treatment, we have to remember that correlation does not guarantee causation and this is worth exploring further.

We can make no comment at this stage about gender affecting results as there was close to an even split between male and female so are not in a position to hypothesise at this point that e.g. Capomulin works better on male mice.

A further area that might be worth exploring in greater detail is the impact of time - on the one mouse examined in detail, the tumour volume went up initially, and then dropped significantly after approximately 18 days.  Was this noted over a range of mice?  The scatter graphs could be extended to cover a greater number to see whether this is common - and examine what implications this gives for treatments.
